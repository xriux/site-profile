## Self Introduction

I have been actively involved in the development of consumer games and social games as a front-end engineer. I have contributed to the development of consumer games and social games for major IPs, providing high-quality and enjoyable gaming experiences for users. With years of experience in C/C++, I have also gained practical development experience in Objective-C, Swift and Cocos2d-x, particularly for mobile platform game development. Furthermore, I have participated in a wide range of projects, including social game development, consumer game development, and iPhone app development. I have a wealth of software development experience and a proven track record in creating smartphone apps, consumer games, Windows apps, and web apps.

In terms of project management, I have experience in Agile development, where I have been responsible for tasks such as sprint planning, backlog management, task breakdown, progress tracking, and meeting facilitation. Believing that smooth communication within the team is essential for project success, I have dedicated myself to fostering effective communication among engineers, designers, and directors, thus improving team productivity and building cooperative relationships.

I have a wealth of experience and a strong passion for game development, enabling me to be involved in various aspects such as proposal and prototyping from the planning stage to operation. Additionally, I have experience staying in the UK, allowing me to comfortably communicate in English and work with English-language materials. I have worked as a communication support for a new IaaS cloud service business, providing interpretation between Japan, the United States, and India, using both English and Japanese. I always strive to enhance my skills and keep up with the latest trends. Recently, I have taken an active interest in AI, and I am proactively learning about these areas.
